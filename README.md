 Project Summary

In this project, I made a special program that helps move data from one place to another. This program uses something called Apache Airflow and it moves data from PostgreSQL to BigQuery.

 What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is a tool that helps manage and arrange a lot of data work. It's like a planner that tells data where to go and what to do in a certain order.

 Why Use Apache Airflow?

- Easy Planning with Python : You can use Python, a programming language, to tell Airflow how to move your data.
- Flexible : Airflow can change depending on what your data needs.
- Easy to Check on Data : It has a good screen where you can see what your data is doing.
- Can Handle Lots of Data : Airflow is really good at working with big or complicated data stuff.
- Lots of Support : Many people use Airflow, so there's a lot of help and new stuff added often.

 What Does This Project Do?

The program I made takes data from PostgreSQL, changes it if needed, and then puts it into BigQuery. We use a smart way of organizing the data in BigQuery so it's easier to work with, especially if there's a lot of it. 

Using Airflow, this project becomes easier to manage and can work with a lot of data without problems. It's like having a really good system to make sure all your data is moved and stored correctly.
